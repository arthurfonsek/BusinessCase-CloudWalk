Business Case: Hiring an AI Developer for 
Member-Get-Member Flutter Application 
1. Executive Summary 
To accelerate growth through referrals, we propose developing a member-get-member 
product as a mobile application built with Flutter. This app will incentivize users to invite new 
members, track referral performance, and generate growth insights. Given our ambition to move 
fast while leveraging cutting-edge tools, we require an AI-enabled developer who can not only 
build the mobile front-end but also integrate AI coding practices and develop a data agent that 
provides actionable insights. 
2. Objectives 
●  Growth Acceleration: Drive organic growth through referrals by enabling users to easily 
invite others and track rewards.  
●  AI-Powered Development: Leverage AI-assisted coding to reduce time-to-market, 
improve quality, and accelerate iteration.  
●  Intelligent Insights: Deploy a data agent to provide growth analytics, user behavior 
insights, and performance forecasts for the referral program.  
●  Cross-Platform Reach: Build a Flutter-based mobile app to cover both iOS and Android 
with a single codebase.  
3. Scope of Work 
The AI Developer will be responsible for: 
1.  Mobile Front-End in Flutter 
 
○  User onboarding and authentication.  
○  Referral link generation and sharing.  
○  Gamified rewards dashboard.  
○  Notifications and progress tracking.  
2.  Backend Integration & Data Layer 
 
○  Referral tracking logic.  
○  API integrations (authentication, payment/reward systems, etc.).  
○  Secure storage and scalable architecture.  
3.  AI Data Agent 
 
○  Automate data collection and cleaning.  
○  Provide referral performance insights (conversion rates, churn risk, referral ROI).  
○  Generate forecasts and recommendations for marketing and growth strategies.  
○  Natural language interface for business users to query growth data.  
4.  AI-Assisted Development Workflow 
 
○  Use AI coding assistants to speed up implementation.  
○  Build maintainable, documented, and testable code with AI review support.  
4. Business Impact 
●  Faster GTM (Go-To-Market): AI-accelerated coding reduces delivery time.  
●  Lower CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): Referrals are cost-effective compared to 
traditional paid channels.  
●  Data-Driven Growth Decisions: Real-time insights from the data agent help optimize 
referral strategies.  
●  Scalable Foundation: Flutter ensures smooth cross-platform growth without duplicating 
development efforts.  
5. Resource Justification 
●  Specialized Skillset: Requires a developer skilled in Flutter, backend integration, and 
AI-assisted coding practices.  
●  Future-Proofing: Having an AI developer establishes a foundation for future AI-driven 
product enhancements.  
●  Cost Efficiency: A single hire covers mobile front-end, backend logic, and AI data 
analytics, reducing the need for multiple specialized hires.  
6. Success Metrics 
●  App MVP launch within 8–10 weeks.  
●  Referral conversion rate uplift by at least 20% over existing acquisition channels.  
●  At least 70% of insights requests automated via the data agent.  
●  Measurable reduction in development time by leveraging AI coding workflows
